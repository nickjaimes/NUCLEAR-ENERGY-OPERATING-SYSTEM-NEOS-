1. Introduction

1.1 The Nuclear Renaissance

Global energy demand is projected to increase by 50% by 2050, while climate change mandates urgent decarbonization of energy systems. Nuclear energy, with its high capacity factor and zero operational emissions, stands poised for significant expansion. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects nuclear capacity must double by 2050 to meet net-zero targets.

However, existing nuclear infrastructure faces challenges:

· Aging Systems: Many plants operate with 1980s-era control technology
· Cybersecurity Threats: Increasing sophistication of state and non-state actors
· Operational Costs: High maintenance and staffing requirements
· Public Perception: Safety concerns exacerbated by legacy system limitations

1.2 The Digital Transformation Imperative

Digital transformation in nuclear energy has lagged behind other critical industries due to regulatory caution and safety concerns. NEOS bridges this gap by providing a certified, secure framework for modernization that maintains and enhances safety while enabling advanced capabilities.

1.3 NEOS Vision

NEOS aims to create an operating system specifically designed for nuclear energy applications that:

· Enhances Safety through redundant, diverse, and fault-tolerant design
· Improves Efficiency through AI optimization and predictive analytics
· Ensures Security through quantum-resistant cryptography and defense-in-depth
· Enables Innovation through open architecture and modular design
· Facilitates Regulation through transparent, auditable operations

Appendices

Appendix A: Mathematical Proofs

Theorem 1 (RMS Schedulability):

```
For a set of n periodic tasks with fixed priorities (rate monotonic),
if the total utilization U = Σ(C_i/T_i) ≤ n(2^(1/n) - 1),
then all tasks will meet their deadlines.
```

Proof:
Let tasks be ordered by period (T_1 ≤ T_2 ≤ ... ≤ T_n).
The worst-case response time R_i for task i occurs when all higher-priority tasks are released simultaneously with i.

The recurrence relation for response time is:

```
R_i^(k+1) = C_i + Σ_{j=1}^{i-1} ⌈R_i^k/T_j⌉ C_j
```

This converges if R_i ≤ T_i.
The utilization bound follows from considering the critical instant and solving the recurrence relation. QED.

Theorem 2 (Quantum Security):

```
For a cryptosystem using Kyber-1024 with 256-bit keys,
the best known quantum attack requires 2^128 operations,
providing 128-bit post-quantum security.
```

Proof:
Kyber is based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem, which reduces to worst-case problems on lattices. The best known quantum algorithm for LWE is the quantum sieve, which has complexity:

```
O(2^(0.265n))
```

where n is the dimension (1024 for Kyber-1024).
Thus, the security level is:

```
2^(0.265*1024) ≈ 2^271 ≫ 2^128
```

QED.

Appendix B: Safety Analysis Results

Fault Tree Analysis for Core Damage:

```
Top Event: Reactor Core Damage
Probability: 1e-7 per reactor-year

Contributing Events:
1. Loss of Coolant + Emergency Cooling Failure (5e-8)
2. Power Excursion + Reactor Trip Failure (3e-8)
3. Earthquake + Structural Failure (2e-8)

Minimal Cut Sets:
1. {Loss of Coolant, Emergency Cooling Failure}
2. {Power Excursion, Reactor Trip Failure}
3. {Earthquake, Structural Failure}

Importance Measures:
- Risk Reduction Worth: 0.95
